# 360 UI Components

This project showcases a collection of UI components with cool animations using Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and motion.dev. The source code is available to the public, allowing developers to explore and utilize these components in their own projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **motion.dev**: A library for creating animations in web applications.

## Installation

To use the components that require Tailwind CSS and motion.dev, you need to install these dependencies:

### Tailwind CSS

1. Install Tailwind CSS via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss
   ```

2. Create a Tailwind configuration file:

   ```

3. Add Tailwind to your CSS:
   ```css
   @import 'tailwindcss';
   ```

### motion.dev

1. Install motion.dev via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install motion-v
   ```

These steps will ensure that the components have the necessary styling and animation capabilities.
